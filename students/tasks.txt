StudentList.java	1	define a nested class 'ListEntry' with a 'Student value' and a 'ListEntry next' property
					2	implement the method 'prepend' that adds a new entry at the start of the list
					3	implement the method 'length' that calculates the length of the list
					4	implement the method 'remove' that removes a Student from the list
