a typical imgur url looks like this:
	https://i.imgur.com/JqV8UP2I.jpg
we want to parse this into
	- whether its https or http (here https)
	- the image id (here JqV8UP2I)
	- the file type (here jpg)

MediaType.java		1	define the enum MediaType
ImageUrl.java		2	implement the constructor of ImageUrl parsing an imgur url into the ImgurUrl object
					3	define getters for the private ImgurUrl fields
