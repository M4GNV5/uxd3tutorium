Recursive linked lists

List.java		1	Implement the method 'count', using a similar approach to the 'add' method.
					The 'count' method shall return the count of elements in the list
				2	Look at the 'get' method, what possible runtime error could occur?
					Is this also a problem for your 'count' implementation?
				3	Implement the 'clamp' method that sets all values <min to min and all
					values >max to max
				4	Implement the 'filter' method that similar to 'clamp' takes a min and a max argument
					but removes values from the list instead of modifying their values when their
					values are <min or >max
