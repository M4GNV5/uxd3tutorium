BinaryNode.java		1	Implement the class BinaryNode
BinaryTree.java		2	initialize the root element of the tree
					3	implement the 'add' method that adds 'val' to the tree
					4	implement the 'has' method that checks if 'val' is in the tree
					
Main.java			5	implement a main method that
							- creates a LinkedList of 100/1000/1e6 entries
							- creates a tree with the same entries
							- compare the speed between calling 'indexOf' on the list vs 'has' on the tree
					6	what is a good start value for the tree?
					7	change the way you initialize the tree so searching in it becomes faster
